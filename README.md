# Restaurant-js

Restaurant sample page using `npm`, `webpack` and `JS`.

The purpose of this project was to make use of `JS` to dynamically render the content of the page. I also implemented:

* A tab-navigation system by appending and removing classes using `JS`.
* Seamless transitions between tabs using transitions.
* Small easter-egg using the console.

## How to setup

### If you are adding or removing any `Sass` or `JS` files:
* Update the `package.json` file and modify the `scripts`: `build`.
* Update the `webpack.config.js` file and modify the entry files according to your modifications.
* Run `npm run-script build`
